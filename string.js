// 1. Greet a User by Name
// Write a program that takes a user’s first name and last name as separate variables and prints a greeting using
//  string concatenation. For example, if the user’s first name is "John" and last name is "Doe",
//   the program should print: "Hello, John Doe!".

// let firstname = "John";
// let lastname = "Doe";
// let fullname = firstname + " " + lastname;
// console.log( "Hello, " + fullname);

// 2. Create a Full Sentence from Variables
// You have three variables: subject, verb, and object. Concatenate them to form a complete sentence. For example,
//  if subject = "The cat", verb = "chased", and object = "the mouse", 
//  the output should be: "The cat chased the mouse.".

// let subject = "The cat";
// let verb = "chased";
// let object = "the mouse";
// let sentence = subject + " "  + verb + " " + object;
// console.log(sentence);

// 3. Form a Sentence About a Favorite Activity
// Ask the user for their name and favorite hobby. Create a sentence that says: "Hello [name],
//  your favorite hobby is [hobby].". For example, if the user inputs "Alice" and "painting",
//   the result should be: "Hello Alice, your favorite hobby is painting.".


// let name1 = "Alice";
// let hobby = "painting";
// let sentence = `${name1}  your favorite hobby is  ${hobby} `
// console.log(sentence);


// __________________________________________________________________________________________


// 4. Combine Two Sentences
// You have two strings stored in variables. Concatenate them into a single string. For example,
//  if str1 = "JavaScript is fun" and str2 = "and very useful.",
//   concatenate them to produce: "JavaScript is fun and very useful.".

// let str1 = "JavaScript is fun";
// let str2 = "and very useful.";
// console.log(str1+" "+str2);

// 5. Create a URL from Parts
// You have three variables: protocol, domain, and path. Use string concatenation to form a complete URL.
//  For example, if protocol = "https", domain = "example.com", and path = "/about",
//   the result should be: "https://example.com/about".


//  let protocol = "https";
// let domain = "example.com";
// let path = "/about";
// console.log(protocol+"://"+domain+path);


//___________________________________________________________________________________________

// 7. Form a Product Description
// Write a program that takes two variables, product and price, and creates a sentence describing the product.
//  For example, if product = "laptop" and price = "$800", the result should be: "This laptop costs $800.".

//  let product = "laptop";
// let price = "$800";
// console.log(`This ${product} costs ${price}.`);

//_______________________________________________________________________________________

// 9. Create a Sentence with a Time and Place
// You have two variables: time and place. Concatenate them into a sentence like: "The meeting is at [time] in [place]."
//  For example, if time = "3 PM" and place = "the conference room",
//   the result should be: "The meeting is at 3 PM in the conference room.".


// let time ="3 PM";
// let place = "the conference room";
// console.log(`The meeting is at ${time} in ${place}.`);


//_______________________________________________________________________________________

//  let movie = "Interstellar";
// let year = 2014;
// console.log(`Your favorite movie is ${movie} which was released in ${year}.`)

//_______________________________________________________________________________________

// 10. Form a Basic Mathematical Statement
// Take two variables, num1 and num2, and use string concatenation to form a simple mathematical statement.
//  For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 10, the result should be: "5 plus 10 equals 15."


//  let num1=5;
// let num2=10;
// let sum = num1+num2;
// console.log(`${num1} plus ${num2} equals ${sum}.`);
